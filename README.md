# Akka.NET Github Defaults  
This repository defines the "community health file" for the Akka.NET project. These are all of the standard Github-specific files designed to define:

1. Code of conduct;
2. Contributor guidelines;
3. Issue and pull request templates; and
4. Support resources and materials.

If you have any suggestions or recommendations for what we should add here, please:

1. Review [Github: Creating a Community Health File](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file) and
2. File [an issue in this repository](https://github.com/akkadotnet/.github/issues/new).
